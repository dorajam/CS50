# CS50

These are partly my solutions to the problem sets for Harvard CS50
implemented in C. I trust you respect any sort of academic honesty
policies and make your own implementations, only using my code as
reference.

Feel free to reach out via dorajambor@gmail.com if you have some great
ideas to implement together.
Happy coding!
